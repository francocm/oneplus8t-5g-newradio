## Changes

* **rev_0004** - `2021-02-06` - `MOD` - Reapplied mod to enable 5G NR on band n78 in EU/UK region. Since **rev_0003** did not introduce changes from OnePlus, and since no additional mods were required compared to the previous mod, this revision is identical to **rev_0002**.
* **rev_0003** - `2021-02-06` - `OP8T_ORIGINAL` - Resynced original carrier policy files as originated from the `Oxygen OS 11.0.6.9.KB05BA` OTA released on January 2021. It is worth noting that these are identical to **rev_0001**, meaning OnePlus has not made any changes. This revision is created for versioning reasons only.
* **rev_0002** - `2021-01-03` - `MOD` - Enabled 5G NR on band n78 in EU/UK region.
* **rev_0001** - `2021-01-03` - `OP8T_ORIGINAL` - Initial commit - OnePlus 8T original files as extracted from stock OP8T device running `Oxygen OS 11.0.6.8.KB05BA` released on 29 December 2020.
